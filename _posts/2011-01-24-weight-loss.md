As you might know, I've been on a weight loss kick for the past four and a bit months â€” that's why you haven't seen me out and about recently. I'm currently half way to my goal weight, and hope to be finished with this dieting and exercise malarkey some time in June.

If you're interested, I've been tracking my progress over at [Slow Down, Fatty](http://slowdownfatty.tumblr.com/){: data-fathom-goal-id="WWIDO0WK"}. Feel free to follow my progress [on Tumblr](http://slowdownfatty.tumblr.com/){: data-fathom-goal-id="WWIDO0WK"} or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/slowdownfatty){: data-fathom-goal-id="QMBFXKRO"}.
