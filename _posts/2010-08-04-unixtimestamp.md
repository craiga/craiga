As [@michaelmessig pointed out earlier today](http://twitter.com/michaelmessig/status/20266598951), `unixtimestamp.com` is currently offline.

What better time to unveil a little project I've been working on for a while now? Introducing [unixtimesta.mp](http://unixtimesta.mp/)!

It does one thing—converting Unix Timestamps into human-readable form—and tries to do it well. [Let me know](mailto:craiga@craiga.id.au) if you see any problems with it or have any suggestions how I might improve it.
