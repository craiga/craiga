> **The Average Color of the Universe**
> 
> What color is the universe? More precisely, if the entire sky were smeared out, what color would the final mix be? This whimsical question came up when trying to determine what stars are commonplace in nearby galaxies. The answer, depicted ab­ove, is a conditionally perceived shade of beige. To determine this, astronomers com­p­ut­a­tion­ally averaged the light emitted by one of the largest sample of galaxies yet analyzed: the 200,000 galaxies of the 2dF survey. The resulting cosmic spec­trum has some em­ission in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but a single perceived composite color.

We live in a beigeniverse.
