So I needed to figure how to come up with a formula for the following graph, given the vertex (i.e. the “turning point”) and the y-intercept.

I remembered [the polynomial form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function#Forms_of_a_quadratic_function) from high school, but that only gave me direct control over the y-intercept, and I was able to find [the vertex form formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function#Forms_of_a_quadratic_function) on Wikipedia which gave me the ability to specify a vertex, but gave me no control over the y-intercept. So, after stretching my brain a bit to remember my high school maths, I came up with the following formula:

 ![f(x) = ((c-h)/(k^2))((x-k)^2)+h](/misc/parabola-formula.png)

- <var>h</var> and <var>k</var> are the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> coordinates of the vertex
- <var>c</var> is the y-intercept

So, in the above example, we substituted <var>h</var> and <var>k</var> for 1 and 2 (the coordinates of the vertex), and <var>c</var> for 1 (the y-intercept).
