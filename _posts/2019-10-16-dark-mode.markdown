Since updating to iOS 13 a few weeks back, I've finally made the switch to dark mode[^late-to-the-party]. I love that my phone no longer lights up a dark room, but switching to apps and sites which don't support dark mode is jarring.

I'm quite suprised how few web sites have implemented dark mode. For a simple site, it's suprisingly easy and [has decent browser support](https://caniuse.com/#search=prefers-color-scheme).

You just need need to override your site's colours inside `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` blocks. For this site, it's as simple as this:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    color: #eee8d5;
    background-color: #000;
  }
  a:hover {
    color: #62ade3;
  }
  .table {
    color: #eee8d5;
  }
  .table th, .table td {
    border-color: #eee8d5;
  }
}
```

[^late-to-the-party]: Yes, I'm super-late to the dark mode party, and still use light mode on my laptop.
