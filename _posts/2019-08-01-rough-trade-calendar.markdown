I'm a huge fan of the gigs Rough Trade put on in their East London shop, and I've been lucky enough to see some pretty amazing shows there:

* [Idles in September 2018](https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/events/rough-trade-east-idles) was an amazing experience which introduced me to the lovely AF GANG;
* [Rough Trade Presents in January](https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/events/rough-trade-east-rough-trade-recommends-penelope-isles-dr-danny-squirrel-flower) introduced me to Penelope Isles, one of my new favourite bands; and
* [Part Chimp in April 2017](https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/events/part-chimp-live-signing) was brutal and wonderful.

I decided to build a service which keeps me up-to-date on their upcoming eventsâ€”introducing [Rough Trade Calendar](https://rough-trade-calendar.herokuapp.com).

The site offers three ways of viewing upcoming events:

* a web page;

* an iCalendar feed you can subscribe to in your calendar app; and

    ![iCalendar feed in Apple's Calendar app](/assets/rough-trade-calendars/icalendar.png)

* an RSS feed you can use to get notified when new events are listed.

I've been using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) to email me whenever a new event is added to this feed.

I'd love to hear if you find this useful! [Please get in touch to let me know](mailto:craiga@craiga.id.au?subject=Rough%20Trade%20Calendar).
