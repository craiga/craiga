# Hello, I'm Craig Anderson

By day, I'm a contracting Python developer specialising in Django. [Check out my <abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr>](/cv) (or [download the PDF version](/cv.pdf) if you prefer). If you'd like to hire me, [please send me an email](mailto:craiga@craiga.id.au). At the moment, I'm available from 31st January.

By night, you might find me exploring my adopted home city of London, seeing live music, or hunting out an obscure craft beer. When back in Melbourne, I might occasionally play bass guitar in [Look Who's Toxic](http://lookwhostoxic.com).

I also run [a little Unix Timestamp conversion site](https://www.unixtimesta.mp).

There are plenty of other things I should be doing, but most of the time I'm dreaming about what I'll do when I grow up while watching bad Star Trek spin-offs.
