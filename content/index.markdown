# Craig Anderson

Australian in London.

By day, he works for [Ten Group](https://www.tengroup.com) as a web developer.

By night, he's probably seeing live music or hunting out an obscure craft beer. When in Australia, he might occasionally play bass guitar in [Look Who's Toxic](http://lookwhostoxic.com).

He also runs [a little Unix TimeÂ­stamp conversion site](https://www.unixtimesta.mp).

There are plenty of other things he should be doing, but most of the time he's dreaming of what he'll do when he grows up while watching bad Star Trek spin-offs.
