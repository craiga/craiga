# Hello, I'm Craig Anderson

By day, I'm a contracting Python web developer specialising in Django. [Check out my CV](/cv) (or [download the PDF version](/cv.pdf) if you prefer). If you'd like to hire me, [please send me an email](mailto:craiga@craiga.id.au). [I'm currently available immediately](https://www.nextfree.co.uk/for/craig-anderson).

By night, you might find me exploring my adopted home city of London, [playing around in the kitchen](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/craiga/things-i-cooked-that-were-great/), seeing live music, or [hunting out an obscure craft beer](https://untappd.com/user/craiganderson). When back in [my home town of Melbourne](/melbourne), I might occasionally play bass guitar in [Look Who's Toxic](http://lookwhostoxic.com).

I also run [a little Unix Timestamp conversion site](https://www.unixtimesta.mp).

There are plenty of other things I should be doing, but most of the time I'm dreaming about what I'll do when I grow up while watching bad Star Trek spin-offs.
