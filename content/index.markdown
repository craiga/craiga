# Craig Anderson

Australian in London.

By day, he works for [Ten Group](https://www.tengroup.com) as a web developer.

By night, he's probably seeing live music or hunting out an obscure craft beer. When in Australia, he might occasionally play bass gui­tar in [Look Who's Tox­ic](http://lookwhostoxic.com).

He also runs [a little Unix Time­stamp con­ver­sion site](https://www.unixtimesta.mp).

There are plen­ty of other things he should be doing, but most of the time he's dreaming of what he'll do when he grows up while watching bad Star Trek spin-offs.
