# So, you're visiting Melbourne?

Great!

The following is a list of places I'd recommend you go in each neighbourhood I'm familiar with. Some of these areas will almost certainly already be on your list, and some of them will probably be a little off the beaten track.

[TOC]

## South of the Yarra

I can't really help you. There are two types of people in Melbourne—those north of the river (typically insufferable left-leaning voters), and those south of the river (typically insufferable right-leaning voters).

If you've met me, I hope you know which side I'm on.

## Fitzroy/Collingwood

This is an area with a history similar to Shoreditch[^shoreditch-vs-fitzroy]—edgy and hip back in its day, but now the domain of expensive shops, expensive restaurants, and overpaid web developers.

Having said that, it's still the heart of the hipster inner north and has lots of what makes Melbourne so Melbourne-y.

### The Old Bar 🍻🎸🔊

Back in the day, you were guaranteed to find me here every Friday night after work, regardless of where I was working. It’s a dive bar with some kind of music every night. The beer garden defintely has more emphasis on beer than garden and should probably be avoided if you're not comfortable with cigarette smoke, but I love it out there.

### The Tote 🍻🎸🔊

Punk rock mecca.

###  The Black Pearl 🍸

Great for cocktails. Go upstairs.

###  Slowbeer Fitzroy 🍺

This place was formerly named Two Row, and I haven't visited since it was relaunched. I can only assume it's still a small, well-curated craft beer bar. Melbourne's craft beer scene is pretty dang friendly.

###  Beermash 🍺🍾

Pretty nice craft beer shop/bar just down the road from Slow Beer.

### Smith and Daughters 🍽🥕

Great vegan restaurant. I've got their cookbook and it's pretty great.

### Smith and Deli 🍽🥕

Take-away spinoff from Smith and Daughters.

### Wabi Sabi Salon 🍽🇯🇵

There's a nice little strip of Japanese restaurants down the bottom of Smith Street, and this is probably my favourite.

### Napier Hotel 🍻🍽

Home of the Bogan Burger, a meaty bohemoth of a burger.

### The Standard Hotel 🍻🍽

Great, but very popular beer garden and pretty good pub food.

### Industry Beans ☕️

If I had to recommend one place to go for Melbourne's over-the-top coffee culture, this would be the one. Please have at least one espresso here.

### Proud Mary ☕️

Another very, very popular cafe. Expect to need to queue if you're going here on the weekend. This is where Zoe and I had our first date.

### Vegie Bar 🍽🥕

Cheap (for the area) and cheerful vegetarian food.

### The Fox Hotel 🍻🍽

## Fitzroy North

I lived in a one bedroom flat by Edinburgh Gardens for just over two years in the early 2010s. It's a very well-to-do area, populated primarily by champagne socialists.

### Edinburgh Gardens 🌳

The biggest and most popular park in the inner north. On a sunny day on the weekend, the north side of the park will be overrun with 20- or 30-somethings with beer, cider, and picnic foods picked up from Piedemontes and Blackhearts and Sparrows.

Danny’s Burgers for an Australian style burger. It’s massive and sloppy. Only get one with the lot. Your wasting your time otherwise.

Horn Please is good for Indian. They had a buffet night on Sunday. And, guess what … craft beer!



## Footscray

After getting a big fed up with the trappings of the hipster inner north, I moved back in the direction of my birthplace and rented a flat in Footscray with in the mid-2010s, where we lived until I left Australia.

Footscray has a repuation of being rough


### The Reverence🍻🎸🔊

A favourite of Melbourne's hardcore scene. Vegan food and punk rock music. Good on Sunday afternoon if you want some heartfelt straightedge.

### Bar Josephene 🍺

### Mr West 🍺🍾

Pho Hung Vuong Saigon is the best Pho in the world. So cheap too.

To’s Bakery for Bahn Mi, Vietnamese rolls.

Konjo Café for Ethiopian breakfast.

Ras Dashen for Ethiopian.

Fox and the Corn for pasta if you’re looking for white people food, but you can probably do just as good if not better in most neighbourhoods.

T. Cavallaro & Sons for cannoli. Holy crap good.

Footscray market for cheap things.

## Northcote/Thornbury

### Carwyn Cellars 🍺🍾



## North Melbourne 

Queen Vic Market for food. Lots of fancy shit to take home. If cooking, I can recommend some stalls for roo meat.




[^shoreditch-vs-fitzroy]: To be fair, Shoreditch is probably a reasonable prediction of what Fitzroy will be like in five years.
