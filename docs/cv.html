It’s a competition conducted over a football season where each competitor attempts to guess (or “tip”) the winner of each week’s matches. Scores are updated weekly, and the winner is the person who tipped the most correct matches during the season. There’s usually a small cash prize involved, but gambling isn’t the main motivation.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:footy-tipping" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class="col-sm-4"> <img src="https://en.gravatar.com/userimage/17008/5ed5e51f6b0afc7be98feeea1585f0dd.jpg?size=400" alt class="img-responsive img-circle"> <div class="text-center"> <a class="btn btn-link btn-lg" href="/" aria-label="Home"><i class="fa fa-home"></i></a> <a class="btn btn-link btn-lg" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigeanderson" aria-label="LinkedIn"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a> <a class="btn btn-link btn-lg" href="https://github.com/craiga" aria-label="GitHub"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a class="btn btn-link btn-lg" href="https://twitter.com/_craiga" aria-label="Twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> <a class="btn btn-link btn-lg" href="https://facebook.com/craiga" aria-label="Facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> <a class="btn btn-link btn-lg" href="https://www.instagram.com/_craiga/" aria-label="Instagram"><i class="fa fa-instagram" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> <a class="btn btn-link btn-lg" href="mailto:craiga@craiga.id.au" aria-label="Email"><i class="fa fa-envelope" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
