            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I'm Craig Anderson, I'm a web developer, and I wanted to share my experience of going to EuroPython this year.</p>
            <p>It's a big conference and this is a short talk so I can't go into too much detail.</p>
            <p>Hopefully it'll give you a few pointers to things to look into.</p>

            <p>Given that this talk is all about my experience, so I thought I should introduce myself.</p>
            <p>I consider myself more of a web developer than a Python.</p>
            <p>I'm not from this part of the world.</p>
            <p>This was my only my second open source conference. I went to DjangoCon a few months back and really loved it. I wrote some blog posts about that which you can take a look at.</p>
            <p>That experience, combined wanting to visit the country my family came from, was my main motivation.</p>

            <p>Going to something like this, you really need to mindful when impostor syndrome starts kicking in.</p>
            <p>They get you to rank your Python experience. 3 stars = intermediate, which felt about right. Met lots of other people who seemed to know way more than I did who were also three stars. I'm not sure what the point of this was.</p>
            <p>That's OK‚ÄîI'm a web developer before I'm a Python developer.</p>

            <p>The first two days were filled with half-day workshops, of which I attended two.</p>
            <p>To be honest, not really worthwhile unless there's a lot you're specifically interested in.</p>
            <p>Probably good for beginners.</p>
            <p>My first workshop was about Pandas and NumPy.</p>
            <p>I've used Pandas before but didn't feel like I really get it, so this was valuable. </p>
            <p>I get the impression that Pandas is quite difficult to learn and its API is volatile.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of non-obvious best practices about when to use nulls and when to use not a number, which I found a bit confusing, but it's good to know that it's a thing.</p>
            <p>I've wanted to get into AWS Lambda for a while, so this was a good intro.</p>
            <p>Was all about Chalice, Amazon's own Lambda serverless framework, and integration with other AWS services.</p>
            <p>Lots of "here's one I made earlier" copying and pasting of CloudFormation templates.</p>
            <p>Discussed Zappa, a competing open source framework with another attendee.</p>
            <p>Also heard about Cloud Tools, a collection of open-source tools to do things like create Cloud Formation templates in Python.</p>
            <p>The workshop instructions are available online.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So, on to the main bit of the conference.</p>
            <p>I really loved the non-technical talks‚Äîtalks about software development as a craft, how to be more inclusive, and how we fit into society at large.</p>
            <p>It might be a bit weird how much I love them.</p>
            <p>Daniele has given this talk at DjangoCon, Pylondinium and now EuroPython. It's got nothing to do with Python and everything to do with how we approach our craft and deal with amateurs. Highly recommended. Daniele is an excellent speaker.</p>
            <p>Ines gave a keynote that cut through a lot of the conventional wisdom that's out there about how to build a business on the internet. Advised against low-value, winner-takes-all spaces.<p>
            <p>Introduced me to the idea of mittelstand (probably botched the pronunciation of that), a class of German, family-owned, middle-sized, middle class business. They're not looking to take over the world, but do the best work in their little area.</p>

            <p>Keith runs a software crafters meetup in Glasgow called CodeCraft. He describes it a guided conversation between software developers. Sounds like an interesting idea and something I'd be very keen to see brought down to London.</p>
            <p>He also spoke about ownership and authorship and how that can promote good cultures in development teams.</p>
            <p>Ed's a London-based developer who's recently been diagnosed with autism, and it was very interesting to hear how that diagnosis has helped him. Also offered lots of concrete advice for making workplaces better for those suffering from autism, which all sounded like great advice anyway: plan work pipelines using Kanban or similar, manage discussions, workplaces with minimal distractions, etc.</p>
            <p>Josh's talk taught me about how Python fits into the UK's education system. He's built a product called Edublocks, which marries the simple drag and drop programming environment Scratch (which is what young children use to learn about the basic concepts of programming) with the power of Python.</p>
            <p>Also, he's only 14 years of age. He was a great speaker, and I look forward to seeing what else he brings to Python, education, and the world at large.</p>
            <p>Ed and Josh's talk actually inspired me to reach out to my sister and her seven year old child who is autistic. I've brought him some toys designed to help teach programming for his upcoming birthday, and I really hope he likes them.</p>

            <p>Moving onto some of the more technically detailed talks.</p>
            <p>The subject of Becky's talk is super-relevant to my current client as Python 2 will not be maintained after January 1, 2020.</p>
            <p>She shared her experience of porting a 65 thousand line Django app from Python 2 to 3 using tools such as caniusepython3 to test dependencies, 2to3 to automate a lot of the conversion, and pylint to detect Python 3 issues which might not be immediately obvious.</p>
            <p>She also discussed writing code which runs across both versions using future, six and modernise, as well as tox for automating testing across Python versions.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>At the end of each day of talks there were a series of lightning talks, which are little five minute talks people can sign up ti give on the day.</p>
            <p>These can be some of the most informative bits of the conference!</p>
            <p>One of the first made the case that the Zen of Python can be harmful when taken as gospel.</p>
            <p>It was initially written with tongue in cheek, and we should remember that when citing it.</p>
            <p>I've only ever copied code from StackOverflow to make my own decorators, so I had no idea how much complexity there is in this area. There were a lot of talks about decorators, which was a new thing to me.</p>
            <p>The decorator package is __insert something about its popularity here__. It handles many of the common gotchas when dealing with decorators, and makes things way more simple at the same time.</p>
            <p>I tried using this in some code I'd written recently and managed to break it, so I've got lots to learn here.</p>
