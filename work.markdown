I can help:

 * **research** your users' wants and needs;
 * **design** a product to satisfy those users;
 * **build** that product;
 * **test** that the product does what was planned; and
 * **iterate** over this process to continuously improve your product.

## What's UHF&nbsp;62?

[UHF 62 Limited](http://uhf62.co.uk) is my limited company. It's named after the TV station "Weird Al" Yankovic's character takes over in the movie [UHF](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/). It's a great film.


## Charitable Giving

I donate 4% of UHF 62's income to charity. In 2021, UHF 62 gave more than Â£6000 to [the Against Malaria Foundation](http://againstmalaria.com), [Crisis](http://crisis.org.uk), [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org), the [Python](https://www.python.org/psf/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/) software foundations, [Tell MAMA](https://tellmamauk.org), [Galop](https://galop.org.uk), [Safe Gigs for Women](https://sgfw.org.uk), [Gig Buddies](https://gigbuddies.org.uk), and [Go Give 1](https://gogiveone.org).
