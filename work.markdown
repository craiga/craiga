I can help you with:

 * building simple websites or complex web applications;
 * developing APIs to expose your data so it can be used in new and exciting ways; and
 * supplementing your team to inject new skills, experience and mentorship.

I'm a specialist in Python and Django, but I'm always up for trying something new.

## What's UHF 62?

[UHF 62 Limited](http://uhf62.co.uk) is my limited company. It's named after the TV station "Weird Al" Yankovic's character takes over in the movie [UHF](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/). I love this movie.


## Charitable Giving

I donate 4% of UHF 62's income to charity. In 2018, UHF 62 gave a total of £2,960 to [the Against Malaria Foundation](http://againstmalaria.com), [Crisis](http://crisis.org.uk), [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org), [the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) and [the Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/).
