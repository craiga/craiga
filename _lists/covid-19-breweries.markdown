A list of breweries with online shops which will deliver beer to me, a member of the public in East London.

I'll try to keep this list up-to-date, but please feel free to [email contributions](mailto:craiga@craiga.id.au) or [submit a pull request via GitHub](https://github.com/craiga/craiga.id.au/edit/master/_lists/covid-19-breweries.markdown).

* [Pressure Drop](https://pressuredropbrewing.co.uk) (they're also running a locals store with free delivery, though delivery slots seem super-limited)
* [Howling Hops](https://www.howlinghops.co.uk/shop/)
* [DEYA](https://shop.deyabrewing.com)


## Places I don't know, but I might give a try
