A list of breweries with online shops which will deliver beer to me, a member of the public in East London.

I'll try to keep this list up-to-date, but please feel free to [email contributions](mailto:craiga@craiga.id.au) or [submit a pull request via GitHub](https://github.com/craiga/craiga.id.au/edit/master/_lists/covid-19-breweries.markdown).

## Local to Me

* [Pressure Drop](https://pressuredropbrewing.co.uk), probably my favourite brewery. They're also running a locals store with free delivery, though delivery slots seem super-limited.
* [Howling Hops](https://www.howlinghops.co.uk/shop/)
* [Signature Brew](https://www.signaturebrew.co.uk/collections/live)

## Elswhere in London

* [The Kernel](https://store.thekernelbrewery.com)
* [Clarkshaws](https://www.clarkshaws.co.uk/shop.html) (I've not tried them, but it was recommended to me by a friend who's local to this brewery)

[Kickign Horse](https://kicking-horse-craft-beer-merchants.myshopify.com) should also be mentioned here. They normally supply beer to restaurants, but have begun a home delivery service.

## Elsewhere in the UK

* [DEYA](https://shop.deyabrewing.com)
* [BrewDog](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/shop)
