By day, [I'm a freelance web developer specialising in Python and Django](/work). [I've given some talks about my work](/talks), and I hope to give more.

By night, you might find me exploring my adopted home city of London, [playing around in the kitchen](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/craiga/things-i-cooked-that-were-great/), [seeing live music](https://www.songkick.com/users/craigeanderson), or [enjoying craft beer](https://untappd.com/user/craiganderson). When back in [my home town of Melbourne](/melbourne), I might occasionally play bass guitar in [Look Who's Toxic](http://lookwhostoxic.com).

I also run [a little Unix Timestamp conversion site](https://www.unixtimesta.mp) and [a board game for a podcast I'm a little embarrassed to be subscribed to](http://gagh.biz/game).
