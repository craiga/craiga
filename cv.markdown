title: Craig Anderson — CV
description: Curriculum Vitae of Craig Anderson, a web developer specialising in Python and Django.
---

I’m a web developer specialising in Python and Django with over {{ "now" | date: "%Y" | minus: 2000 }} years of experience. I’m pursuing freelance roles as it should, in time, give me more flexibility to move as my partner’s academic career demands. I’m motivated by work for social and environmental good.

I love pets, but unfortunately I'm unable to work in an office with them as I live with somebody with severe allergies.
