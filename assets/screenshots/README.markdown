These screen shots were taken with a Safari window resized to occupy the whole screen of my 15 inch 2017 MacBook Pro.

Then I:

 * press Command+Shift+4 to enter screen shot mode;
 * press the space bar to enter whole-window mode; then
 * click on the window while holding down the Option key to take a screen shot without a drop shadow.
