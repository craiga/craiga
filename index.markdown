By day, [I'm a <span itemprop="jobTitle">freelance web developer specialising in <span itemprop="knowsAbout">Python</span> and <span itemprop="knowsAbout">Django</span></span>](/work). [I've given some talks about my work](/talks), and I hope to give more.

By night, you might find me exploring my adopted home city of London [seeing <span itemprop="knowsAbout">live music</span>](https://www.songkick.com/users/craigeanderson), [enjoying <span itemprop="knowsAbout">craft beer</span>](https://untappd.com/user/craiganderson), or [playing around in the kitchen](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/craiga/things-i-cooked-that-were-great/). When back in [my home town of <span itemprop="knowsAbout">Melbourne</span>](/melbourne), I might occasionally play bass guitar in [Look Who's Toxic](http://lookwhostoxic.com){: itemprop="memberOf"}.

I also run [a Unix Timestamp conversion site](https://www.unixtimesta.mp), [a board game for a podcast I'm a little embarrassed to be subscribed to](http://gagh.biz/game), and [a site tracking upcoming events at Rough Trade stores](https://rough-trade-calendar.herokuapp.com).
