By day, [I'm a freelance web developer specialising in Python and Django](/work). [I've given some talks about my work](/talks), and I hope to give more.

By night, you might find me exploring my adopted home city of London [🎶seeing live music](https://www.songkick.com/users/craigeanderson){:data-fathom-goal-id="XESRNZMT"}, [🍻enjoying craft beer](https://untappd.com/user/craiganderson){:data-fathom-goal-id="RI7RSBCK"}, or [🥦playing around in the kitchen](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/craiga/things-i-cooked-that-were-great/){:data-fathom-goal-id="CPBM8UL5"}. When back in [🌏my home town of Melbourne](/melbourne), I might occasionally play bass guitar in [🎸Look Who's Toxic](http://lookwhostoxic.com){:data-fathom-goal-id="JUQR3XLO"}.

I also run [⏱a Unix Timestamp conversion site](https://www.unixtimesta.mp){:data-fathom-goal-id="RIVS7KEW"}, [🎲a board game for a podcast I'm a little embarrassed to be subscribed to](http://gagh.biz/game){:data-fathom-goal-id="CDWN0BWW"}, and [🗓a site tracking upcoming events at Rough Trade stores](https://rough-trade-calendars.craiga.id.au){:data-fathom-goal-id="FN3V3C8A"}.
